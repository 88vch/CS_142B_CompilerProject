### What is a Compiler
- a program designed to turn the source code into a lower level representation 
    - Source Code -> Assembly Code (Linked with Libs then ->) Binary Code (executable)
        - we do NOT need to handle linking!
    - source code turns into a .asm file
    - .asm file turns into a .o file
-
